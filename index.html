Cancellation Fees
9 months ago Updated
If a business partner cancels a confirmed Gig within 24 hours of the Gig Start Time, the business may be required to pay fees of up to 50% of the value of the Gig:

If a Business cancels a confirmed Gig within 24 hours before the start time of the Gig, Business may be required and agrees to pay 50% of the Charges of the Gig, including both the Payment for the Pro, Stripe Fee, and the Platform Fee. If more than 24 hours’ notice of cancellation is given, there will be no charge to Business.

If Business instructs the Pro to stop work earlier than the time posted for that Gig, the Business may be required to pay all the Charges associated with the Pro Services received and 50% of the Charges for any time remaining in the Gig. For example, for a Gig which is an 8-hour shift, if Business ends the shift after 4 hours, Business will be charged for the 4 hours the Pro worked, plus 2 hours (50% of the Gig time remaining but not worked).

See our terms for reference here https://www.gigpro.com/terms-and-conditions. If you have any questions, click here to fill out our business support form and we will be glad to assist you.

Pros do not "Clock In" or "Clock Out" to Gigs
1 day ago Updated
Pros do not clock in or out on our platform. Some of our business partners have a sign-in sheet. Our platform operates on the "honor" system for Pros working Gigs. We have an update in the works for a time clock feature that we hope to have out soon.

In the meantime, Pros are suggested to arrive at their confirmed Gig before or by the Gig start time. Once the Gig is "over" the business will be notified to rate and pay the Pro. If the Pro did not work the stated shift time in the Gig card our platform allows the business to adjust hours to reflect the actual time the Pro worked.

If you have a question about the shift times of a Gig or adjusting hours for a Gig, please refer to the links in this article which will take you to the respective articles for those features or click here to fill out our business support form and we will be glad to assist you.

 

**We have released a Time Clock Feature in the following markets: Greenville, Atlanta, Louisville, Richmond, Philadelphia, Austin, Chicago, Columbus, San Antonio, Tampa, Nashville, Savannah & Asheville. If a Pro is in one of these markets, they are required to use the Time Clock Feature**

Pros (workers) have OAI Insurance with Gigpro
9 months ago Updated
We hope no one ever gets hurt on a Gig, but things do happen on occasion. Pros working on the Gigpro platform are protected from injury by our OAI (Occupational Accident Insurance) policy, so Pros on the platform will always be taken care of.

Pros pay only $0.38/hr for this protection, which is deducted from their Gig earnings so coverage will never lapse. For more information on OAI, see our More OAI Info article or our More OAI Blog Posts. If a Pro is injured on a Gig, please see the article Pro Injuries on Gigs.

Gigpro Background Check Feature
9 months ago Updated
Gigpro offers a free background check to all Pros, and we offer our business partners the ability to post Gigs where a background check is required to apply.

For Pros, background checks include city, county, state, and national searches. They can take several weeks to come back.

For business partners, Gigs posted with a background check requirement will mean any applicants for the Gig will have to pass the background screen before they can apply for the Gig. This means every applicant for your background check required Gig will have already passed through the background screening. Also, Background cleared Pros must have at least one completed Gig and maintain a 4+ star rating to apply to Background Check required Gigs.

For more information about our background screening process and the fees associated with background check required Gigs, click here to fill out our business support form and we will have our Accounts Team reach out to you.



Tips or Gratuity for Gigs
9 months ago Updated
Gigs on the Gigpro platform are considered flat rate, meaning that the rate per hour for the Gig is all the Pro should expect to be paid. If a Gig is posted for $20/hr. then the Pro should expect to be paid $20/hr. for the Gig less the OAI (Occupational Accident Insurance) fee and that is all.

Most of the Gigs on our platform will not include tips or gratuity.

If a Gig description includes the words "plus tips" or "plus gratuity", then the business will be expected to pay the Pro tips in cash at the end of the shift. If the Gig description does not include these terms, then the Pro should not expect to be paid tips for the Gig.

How Gigpro Works
9 months ago Updated
Welcome to Gigpro! We are glad you are here to either Find Work and Get Paid or get the extra help you need in your business. Here is how the Gigpro process of filling a Gig works:

Businesses post Gigs and can request multiple Pros for a shift if they wish.
Pros apply to Gigs and applications will be listed in the “Applied” tab on the home page of the app.
Businesses will select all the applications they like for each Gig from the pool of applications they receive.
Pros who are selected for Gigs will be notified in the app. Pros will only hear about their Gig applications if they are selected for a Gig.
Pros must confirm the selection by the business within the app, the first Pro to confirm gets the Gig.
The Pro will go work the Gig and the business will pay the Pro within 48 hours after the end of the Gig
Once a business pays the Pro, the Pro will be notified they have been paid. The Pro can either wait for the money to be sent to them from their Stripe account or they can use the Gigpro Instant Pay feature to get their money in 30 minutes or less.
Businesses keep posting Gigs as they need, and Pros keep applying to and working Gigs as they want to.
We hope this helps, if you have any more questions, click here to fill out our business support form and we will be glad to help. Thanks for using the Gigpro platform!

Business Fees for Gigpro
9 months ago Updated
Gigpro charges fees for completed Gigs. There are no signup, subscription, posting, recruiting or placement fees.

ID Verification for Pros
9 months ago Updated
Gigpro uses Stripe's IDV software. Stripe is Gigpro's third-party payment processor; they are the largest online payment processor in the world. All Pros using the Gigpro platform are required to provide both a valid ID (meaning in hand, undamaged, and unexpired) as well as SSN or ITIN for tax purposes before they can apply to Gigs. If a Pro cannot provide this documentation, the Pro cannot complete their profile and apply to Gigs.


Occupational Accident Insurance protects the Pro and Business by serving as the injury policy of record in the event a Pro is injured during a shift. 

 

What is OAI?

Occupational Accident Insurance, or OAI, is an alternative solution to Workers Compensation. Workers Compensation is for W-2 employees only and does not apply to 1099 Independent Contractors coming in to pick up a shift. Workers Compensation is an employer sponsored policy and responsibility. OAI is an Independent Contractor policy and responsibility that is sponsored by an associated company (Gigpro). The cost of the coverage for each shift ($0.38/hour) is withheld from the Pro’s payment and paid on their behalf. OAI is required for all Pros on all shifts on Gigpro, with no exceptions being made. 

 recent blog post OAI: https://www.gigpro.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-occupational-accident-insurance-and-workers-comp/

OAI does not cover: Drivers, Gas powered machinery (backpack blowers or lawn equipment), Heavy machinery (forklifts), Automated machinery (bottlers), Ladders, or Security Gigs where touching another person or their belongings is required. ID & Ticket scanning is allowed.

 

For even more information see our recent blog post here. If you have any questions about the OAI policy and it’s coverage, please click here to fill out our business support form and we will be glad to assist you.

 

What do I do if a Pro is injured while working a Gig at my business?

Immediately get the Pro the appropriate care they need. Then advise the Pro to reach out to Gigpro Support to get the claims process started, or provide them the information in this article Pro Injuries on Gigs. This will entail an online claims form and a specialist’s assistance along the way.
